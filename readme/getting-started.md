# Getting Started

#### Step 1:  Register

Choose the _Register_ link, and enter your:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email Address
* Password

Then press _Register and Accept Invite_.

#### Step 2:  Account Verification

We'll send an email to the email address specified in Step 1.  Access that via your email client, and click on the link within the email to verify your email address.  You'll be taken to the Gateway application with confirmation that your account has been verified.  Press _Continue_ and you'll be prompted to log into the gateway using the email address and password specified in Step 1. &#x20;

#### Step 3:  Agree to the Terms of Use

Read the Terms of Use and then select _I Accept_.

#### Step 4:  Organization Not Found

The gateway application will attempt to locate and prepopulate your Organization details based on the domain of the email address specified in Step 1.  If your Organization was found, then skip to Step 5.  Otherwise, you will be prompted to setup your Organization.  Enter the following:

* Organization Name (the name of your organization / company)
* Founded (the year the Organization was founded)
* Description (a description of your Organization)

Then enter the following.  Multiple values can be specified, so utilize the _Primary_ option to make one in a list the primary value.

* Other Names (for example, a sub-company or division name)
* Primary Domain (the primary web domain of your Organization, ie. unifiedcompliance.com)
* Social Addresses (enter at least two social addresses for your Organization, ie. [https://www.facebook.com/UnifiedCompliance/](https://www.facebook.com/UnifiedCompliance/) and [https://twitter.com/the\_ucf](https://twitter.com/the\_ucf)).  The following social sites are supported:  Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Github, Medium, Vimeo, Pintrest, Reddit, and Dribble.
* Primary Address (enter a primary address of your Organization)
* Primary Phone (enter a primary phone number of your Organization)
* Primary Email (enter an email address of your Organization)

#### Step 5:  Finish your Account Details

Now you can finish the setup of your account, by specifying:

* Account Name - different from the First & Last name on Signup right?
* Account Address
* Account Phone Number

#### Step 6: Choose Your Subscription

Select the subscription plan that best suits your needs.  Choose _Monthly_ (your subscription will automatically be renewed once per month) or _Yearly_ (your subscription will automatically be renewed annually).  After making your selection, you will be prompted for your billing information.

#### Step 6:  Specify a Billing Contact and Payment Method

First, specify billing contact details.  This contact information can be different from the main account holder contact details (for example, if you have a person/group within your Organization that is responsible for billing).  Specify the following:

* Billing Contact Name (the name of the person responsible for billing)
* Billing Contact Email (the email address of the billing contact)
* Billing Address (the street, city, state and zip code of the billing contact)
* Billing Contact Phone Number (the phone number of the billing contact)

Second, choose from one of the following payment types:  Credit Card, ACH Direct Debit, or Purchase Order.

For Credit Card payment, specify the following:

* Credit Card Number
* Credit Card Expiry Date
* Credit Card Security Code (the 3 or 4 digit code on the back of the card)

For ACH Direct Debit Payment, specify the following:

* Bank Name (the financial institution)
* Account Type (either _Checking_ or _Savings_)
* Routing Number (the routing number associated with the bank account)
* Account Number (the account number associated with the bank account)

Note:  A bank account payment method will need verification before it can be used for funding.  You will receive two small deposits into your bank account for verification purposes, which will appear in your account within 1-2 business days.  Your statement will have a description that includes AMTS followed by the two micro-deposit amounts.  Once you have received the deposits, please return to the gateway application and enter the amounts in order to verify your bank account.  In following this verification process, you authorize Unified Compliance to electronically credit and, if necessary, debit your account to correct erroneous credits.
