# Become a Contributor

Become a Contributor and you can add valuable information to the Unified Compliance Federated database.  From the main Profile page, select the _Become a Contributor_ button.

The API Gateway will perform two lookups using your profile information:

1. Look up your information in the Unified Compliance Federated database.  If found, then the information will be pre-populated and you can select the _Save_ button.
2. If no person was found in the Federated database, then the gateway will look up your information using an Internet-based service.  If found, then the information will be pre-populated and you can select the _Save_ button.  If not found, then you will need to provide the information described below.
