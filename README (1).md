# What is the Unified Compliance API Gateway?

![](.gitbook/assets/260x260white\_background.png)

The Unified Compliance API Gateway is a software platform where your organization can interact with the Unified Compliance Federated database. API developers can make API calls to the gateway to retrieve, post, and update data. &#x20;

The API Gateway supports RESTful APIs that:

* Are HTTP-based
* Enable stateless client-server communication
* Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and PUT
* Utilize an API Key for authentication

The onboarding flow of the gateway will guide you through the process of registering, which includes:

* Creation of your admin, user, and master accounts
* Creation of your organization
* Enrollment in a subscription plan
* Creation of a payment method

Then, you can invite team members to your account.

A subscription plan will provide you with API tokens. Tokens are deducted each time your team makes an API call.  Need more tokens?  No problem - visit the Funding page to add more tokens to your account manually.

To see how to get started, visit the [next section](readme/getting-started.md) of this guide.
