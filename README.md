The Unified Compliance API Gateway is a platform where your Organization can interact with the Unified Compliance Federated database. API developers can make API calls to the gateway to retrieve, post, and update data. &#x20;

The API Gateway supports RESTful APIs that:

* Are HTTP-based
* Enable stateless client-server communication
* Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and PUT
* Utilize an API Key for authentication
